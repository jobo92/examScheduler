# examScheduler
A simple exam scheduler, which takes in input a *students.txt* comma separated values file with as columns 
* Student ID
* Student Name
* Student Surname

Inside the source you can find instruction to transform the student list copy-pasted from the Balckboard web interface (seriously, why no export function Blackboard?) in the required format.

Feel free to use it, and let me know if you find any problems (very likely).
